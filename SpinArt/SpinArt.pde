* TITLE  : Interactive-Generative Spin Art
* AUTHOR : TRISTAN FARRELL
* PROJECT: ISTA 301 Final Project
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*  This project contains five paintings which were randomly generated
*  by an algorithm. The creation was recorded and this program displays
*  each painting and its creation. It is interactive so the user can
*  switch between paintings by pressing ENTER and they can choose which 
*  part of the creation(pour,flick,spin) they want to view by 
*  pressing numbers 1-3. All files are inside data folder.
*  The Painting class holds information for each of the 5 paintings.
*
* ALGORITHM:
*  Colors(1:White,2:Brown,3:Red,4:Orange,5:Yellow,6:Green,
*         7:Light Blue,8:Blue,9:Dark Blue,10:Purple,11:Pink,12:Black)
*  #Colors: 6-sided dice roll
*  Colors: 12-sided dice roll
*  Spin Speed: 6-sided dice roll
*  Flicks: Coin Flip # of heads in a row
*  Repeat: 4-sided dice roll
*
*  Generate each variable value randomly, then apply each paint color
*  to the canvas in order of selection. Repeat paint application as many
*  times as generated. Then flick a stick through the paint by the flick
*  number generated. Then spin the painting at the speed generated.
